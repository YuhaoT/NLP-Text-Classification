# NLP-Text-Classification
Extracting headline from Wikipedia by using regex with an text-extractor provided by instructor(code for text-extractor not include), then do a frame detection on it. 
Naturally, frame detection can be viewed as a text classification task, where the text are the news headlines and the classes/categories are the frames. We will take this approach to try and predict the news headlines.
I implement Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bays for it, and also write my own code to calculate the accuracy in our_metrics.py
